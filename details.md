# GPS Dozor AI Case Study - Details

## Project Context

**Purpose:** Deliver a practical app based on GPS Dozor API data that demonstrates product thinking and AI-assisted development workflow.
**Stakeholders:** Candidate (author), hiring team/reviewer.
**Timeline:** 2026-02-19 - 7 days from assignment receipt.

## Team

**Owner:** Nguyen The Anh
**Support:** AI coding assistants/tools

## Integration Points

**Primary API docs:** https://www.gpsdozor.cz/documentation/api
**Repository:** TBD (public GitHub required by assignment)

## Technical Context

- Must consume at least 3 API endpoints.
- Should prioritize clarity over feature count.
- Frontend framework optional; Vue can score extra points.
- Optional enrichment API (weather/geocoding/traffic) can add value.

## Risks and Notes

- API auth/rate limits are unknown until tested.
- Data model and endpoint naming should be validated early.
- Visualization choice should match user decision-making, not just aesthetics.

## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Owner |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 2026-02-19 | Use a dashboard-style use case | Best fit for multi-endpoint + visualization + filters | Nguyen The Anh |
