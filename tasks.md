## Completed Tasks

- [x] Define app persona and core use case (Fleet Efficiency Dashboard).
- [x] Run API integration spike (GPS Dozor + Windy + Open-Meteo).
- [x] Set up repository and base frontend project (Vue 3 + TS + Vite).
- [x] Implement API client layer with typed response models and mappers.
- [x] Implement secure API access via Vite proxy (hidden credentials).
- [x] Implement Pinia State Management for centralized app state.
- [x] Build advanced visualizations:
    - [x] Fleet Map with speed-based path color-coding and dynamic legend.
    - [x] Custom Truck Icons with status-based coloring.
    - [x] Trip Chart (distance/fuel/speed).
    - [x] KPI Cards (total distance, fuel, active vehicles).
- [x] Implement "Smart" Features:
    - [x] Driver Scoring Algorithm (Grade A-F).
    - [x] Fuel Efficiency & Safety variance analysis.
    - [x] Human-readable trip summaries.
- [x] Add interactive filters (date range, vehicle selection).
- [x] Implement external API enrichment:
    - [x] Open-Meteo for historical weather context.
    - [x] Windy Webcams for visual context near trip destinations.
- [x] Add API Evidence Panel for transparency.
- [x] Write unit tests for data mappers and metric utilities (100% pass).
- [x] Fix TypeScript build errors and ensure clean production build.
- [x] Write final submission README.

## Submission Checklist

- [x] App uses >=3 GPS Dozor endpoints (`/groups`, `/vehicles`, `/trips`, `/history`).
- [x] At least one clear visualization is present (Map + Chart).
- [x] User can filter/interact with data.
- [x] Value proposition and target user are explicit (Fleet Efficiency).
- [x] GitHub repo is public and runnable.
- [x] README includes workflow, issues, and improvements.
